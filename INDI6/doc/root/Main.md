## Structure

The root of a particular document may start at the Set & Volume, Book & Chapter, Collection & Article, or other hierarchy level.

### Set & Volume

A _Set_ is a collection of _Volumes_ which may be divided alphabetically, by Topic and Sub-topic, etc. Think of it as an old-fashioned encyclopedia. 

### Book & Chapter

A _Book_ typically is a collection of _Chapters_ (or _Prefaces_, _Appendices_, etc.) on a certain topic.

### Collection & Article

A _Collection_ is a set of somewhat related _Articles_, that stand alone rather than being part of a book. Technical notes are a good example of an article.

## Conventions

### Navigation

A navigation line will be at the top of each page immediately below the **Title** heading.
